            <p>
                 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello! My name is Repciuc Valentin-Adrian, I live in the city of Murfatlar, county of Constanta and I am 20 years old.
                Mu passion for computer science started because of video games, being a more curious child I wanted to find out how a game or a website was created.</p>
            
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At the very beginning I had some fear in starting to study computer science alone, so I decided to push myself from behind and enroll in a computer science faculty and that's how I became a student of Ovidius University in Constanta.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I can proudly say that I got to study with pleasure and learn new things every day. In the first year still in progress, I have accumulated knowledge about: Assembly, C, C++, Java, Relational Databases, Cyber ​​Security, Algorithmic, Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence and Digital Marketing and more material is still being added, yes I am not a professional in these fields, but I have some foundations and knowledge that I didn't have last year and I'm sure that I will perfect myself in time.
                I also started to study HTML and CSS on my own, soon I will also want to study JavaScript, last year I did not imagine that I would start a project in which I would create my own website about myself.
            </p>
